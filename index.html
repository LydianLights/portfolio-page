          <h2>Who I am...</h2>
          <p>
            I've always had a passion for problem solving. From a young age, I was drawn into the world of mathematics and science for their ability to take information we know and transform it in a way that teaches us something new. The appeal of that discovery process fueled me, pressed me to always be curious and questioning. When I got my first programmable TI-84 calculator around high school, I got my first taste of what programming actually was. The ability to build something useful out of pure logic--that was something <em>cool.</em> For me, programming is the perfect career.
          </p>
          <h2>What I do...</h2>
          <p>
            I'm currently putting the pedal to the metal at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus Code School</a> to hone my abilities and become the best developer I can be. At Epicodus I hope to take my current knowlege to the <code>nth</code> level, and really push myself as a problem solver. After that, the sky is the limit.
