                    This is just a simple project I made in my spare time to learn how screensavers actually work. The project features the character D.va from the popular game Overwatch floating amusingly across the screen. It taught me some interesting things about screensavers and the WPF framework, which I used to build it.

                    Chillbot is a chat bot for the Discord chat service made in C#. I made Chillbot mostly for a laugh with my friends. It features the ability to be commanded to "tell" other users things, to greet users in a multitude of ways, and to parse "d20" type dice commands. Unfortunately Chillbot is currently in a state of disrepair after the .NET discord bot framework was changed.

                    This was a fun project that taught me a lot about API's and interacting with servers. Currently the project isn't very complete, and has a fair few usability bugs, but it functions well enough that I use it occasionally. One of these days I'll get around to finishing it properly.

                    This project was a part of my Epicodus cirriculum, and taught me a lot about the Bootstrap framework. It's a <span class="questionable">semi-passable</span> recreation of the Wikipedia home page made for educational puposes.

                    This is another Epicodus project given as an assignment to test our CSS and HTML know-how. It's actually currently under construction and due in about 1hr 40min. I just hope I make the turn-in deadline on time... but I'm pretty confident. It's mostly content work now, and some small tweaks I have in mind to make things a little nicer. Wish me luck!

                    Perhaps my greatest programatic achievement thus far. This masterpiece was yet another Epicodus assignment directed at introducing us to the bare basics of HTML and CSS. You gotta start somewhere!
